== What is Antora?

With Antora, you manage docs as code. That means your documentation process benefits from the same practices used to produce successful software.

Some of these practices include:

* Storing content in a version control system.
* Separating content, configuration, and presentation.
* Leveraging automation for compilation, validation, verification, and publishing.
* Reusing shared materials (DRY).

Antora helps you incorporate these practices into your documentation workflow. As a result, your documentation is much easier to manage, maintain, and enhance.

== How Antora works

Antoraâ€™s site generator handles all aspects of creating a documentation site, from fetching and aggregating to converting and arranging the content to publishing the files of the generated site. This page describes that process in detail.

The default pipeline is opinionated to get you started as quickly as possible. But understand that Antora features a modular, open architecture. That means this architecture can accommodate specialized use cases by allowing custom Antora components, such as a validators, to be inserted into the pipeline at strategic points as needed. This page focuses on the core, built-in Antora components and capabilities in Antora.
